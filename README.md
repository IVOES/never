# Never - functional programming language

Never is a simple functional progamming laguage. Technically it may be classified as syntactically scoped, 
strongly typed, call by value, pure functional programming language.

In practise it offers first order functions and some mathematical functions to make it useful for some small purposes.

## Introduction

```
func main() -> float
{
    return 100 * 1.8 + 32;
}
```

A program written in Never language stars in function ```main```. Main function always takes no parameters
and returns float value. The function may only return value of one expression. In the above example temperature
of boiling water given in Celsius degrees is converted to Fahrenheit degrees. In practse, however, one will
define a function which will convert any degree value.
